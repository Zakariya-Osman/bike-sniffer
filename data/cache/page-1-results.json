        "description": "An early 1990s Tech Twosome Tandem 21 speed road bike. It is in very good condition. Shifters and brakes are adjusted to function perfectly. The gear range goes low enough to handle Calgary’s hills but still high enough to really get some speed up. The bike is very light and quick, very clean and looks great. Great for out on the road or hitting the bike paths.
